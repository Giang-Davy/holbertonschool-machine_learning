## **About Me**  
I'm **[Davy](https://github.com/Giang-Davy)**, a developer with a passion for mathematics and computer science. I enjoy solving complex problems through algorithmic approaches. You can follow me on **[Linkedlin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davy-dang-vu-956059322/)**.

## **Project Description**  
The **Binomial Distribution Calculator** is a tool designed to perform calculations related to the binomial distribution. This application helps you compute:

- **Probability Mass Function (PMF)**
- **Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)**
- **Mean and Variance** of a binomial distribution
- **Binomial coefficients**

The goal of this project is to provide a user-friendly interface to perform statistical calculations for binomial distributions without relying on external libraries like **NumPy** or **SciPy**. This is particularly useful for students, researchers, and anyone interested in better understanding and applying the binomial distribution.

## **Development Journey**  
This project began as an exploration of probability theory, with a focus on the **binomial distribution**. Initially, I created a simple implementation for calculating the **probability mass function** (PMF) of the binomial distribution. Over time, I expanded the functionality to include other features such as:

- Calculating the **Cumulative Distribution Function** (CDF)
- Implementing the **mean** and **variance** of a binomial distribution
- Handling the **binomial coefficients** to calculate probabilities for any given values of **n** and **p**

Key milestones during development:
- âœ… Implemented **PMF** and **CDF** calculations
- âœ… Calculated **mean** and **variance** for the distribution
- ðŸ”„ Ongoing development to improve the user interface and add more statistical distributions
- ðŸš€ Future plans include **support for other probability distributions** like Poisson and Normal

## **Challenges & Lessons Learned**  
One of the most challenging aspects of this project was correctly implementing the **binomial coefficients** and ensuring accurate calculations for **large n values**. I had to handle rounding issues and large intermediate values to ensure that the program remains efficient while calculating factorials.

I also learned a lot about **probability theory**, especially the importance of understanding the **parameters of the binomial distribution** (i.e., the number of trials and probability of success). This understanding allowed me to build a more robust and flexible tool for working with binomial distributions.
