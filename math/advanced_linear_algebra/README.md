## **Project Description**  
The **Advanced Linear Algebra Calculator** is an application that allows you to perform advanced matrix calculations such as:

- **Determinant calculation**
- **Minor and cofactor calculation**
- Solving **linear systems** (e.g., using matrix inversion or Gaussian elimination)
- **Eigenvalue** and **eigenvector** calculation
- Matrix **inversion** and other matrix operations

The goal of this project is to provide a simple interface for performing complex linear algebra calculations without the need for a heavy mathematical library like **NumPy**. This project is particularly useful for students, researchers, or anyone who wants to understand and visualize linear algebra concepts in a practical way.

## **Development Journey**  
This project started as a way to deeply understand **linear algebra** and apply its principles in an algorithmic context. Initially, I wanted to create a tool that could perform basic matrix calculations. Over time, I expanded its functionality to cover advanced operations, focusing on:

- Implementing **matrix manipulation algorithms** such as Gaussian elimination and matrix inversion
- Working with **Eigenvalues** and **Eigenvectors** for solving real-world problems like optimization
- Incorporating features for advanced matrix operations while keeping the project simple and efficient

Key milestones during development:
- âœ… Implemented **determinant** and **minor/cofactor calculation**
- âœ… Developed **matrix inversion algorithms**
- ðŸ”„ Still working on **support for larger matrices and optimization algorithms**
- ðŸš€ Future plans include **adding more matrix decomposition techniques like LU and QR decomposition**

## **Challenges & Lessons Learned**  
One of the most challenging aspects of this project was implementing **matrix inversion** without relying on third-party libraries. I spent a lot of time researching various methods, like **Gaussian elimination** and **Cramer's rule**, to ensure the implementation was both efficient and numerically stable. I also encountered difficulties with **eigenvalue decomposition** and needed to refine my understanding of **linear algebra theory** to implement the algorithm correctly.

During this process, I learned a lot about **numerical methods** and the importance of stability when working with large matrices. The project has helped me improve my problem-solving skills and deepened my understanding of both **math** and **software development**.
